Algovis, An Experiment to visualize the algorithms imitating the conventional classroom teaching approach.<br>
Visualizations are dynamic in a way that enables any novice student to understand the algorithms effectively.
<br>
<br>

Algorithm visualizations currently available: <br>
1. Linear search
2. Binary search
3. Bubble sort
4. Optimized Bubble sort
5. Merge sort 
6. Insertion sort (Under Development)
7. Selection sort (Under Development)
8. K Means Clustering

You can download the code from this repository <br>
Download the zip and extract it.<br>
Run the index.html and you are good to go without any other requirements.<br>
Feel free to experiment and change a line of code here and there and see what changes happen. <br>

#### If stuck ?
1. If the animation is stuck or not starting, then clear the cache of the browser and restart the browser.
2. Even then if it does not work then try using a different browser.

<h5>NOTE :</h5> <p><b> 

1. All visualizations are tested in various browsers. All visualizations work perfectly except the merge sort in firefox browser due to its internal bug.</b></p> 
2. K means clustering visualization was taken from here : https://github.com/hckr/k-means-visualization .


You can see the visualizations at   https://chiranjeevikarthik.me/Algovis/

#### Update:
1. Several Cheatsheets for various subjects are added. (May 2019). <br>
2. A new Dataset section is added. (Jun 2019).
