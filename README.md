# Algovis
<br>
Algovis, a simple way of learning algorithms through visualizations.
I believe that every student, regardless of his learning capability can easily
grasp various things when they are visually taught.
I am presently working to create various visualizations.
Once I'm successful, then im are going to extend this learning platform even further 
by making a system that can visualize many possible programs under a language.<br>
That's all for now.!

We have developed Algorithm visualizations for below Algorithms currently: <br>
1. Linear search
2. Binary search
3. Bubble sort
4. Optimized Bubble sort
5. Merge sort 

You can download the code from Algovis git repository: https://github.com/karthikchiru12/Algovis <br>
Download the zip and extract it. <br>
Run the index.html and you are good to go without any other requirements.<br>
Feel free to experiment and change a line of code here and there and see what changes happen. <br>

#### Issues
1. If the animation is stuck or not starting, then clear the cache of the browser and restart the browser.
2. Even then if it does not work then try using a different browser.

<h5>NOTE :</h5> <p><b> All visualizations are tested in browsers that use chromium engine. All visualizations work perfectly in the chromium based browsers.
Other browsers show some issues and are not displaying all visualizations correctly.</b></p>

You can see the visualizations we had developed at   https://chiranjeevikarthik.me/Algovis/
